# How to make bread

I show people how to make home bread. Many people try a beginner's recipe, but they do not know what many people actually do. I show people how to bake bread right, so that they don't get upset. 

Baking bread has been my passion since I was 19. I worked as a baker, craftsman baker, bakery manager, bakery owner, wholesale bakery owner, managing director of bakery and now content developer on an online website. 

I love baking bread avenues and how much enjoyment a basic daily commodity can offer. My website, Busby's Bakery School, shows my passion with others because I have a large batch of dough on the table always. 

Here's how to make bread at home: 

Weigh the elements 
In order to produce bread, we weigh the ingredients first. To weigh each subject in grammes with a scale. Water is also weighed, never measured in a jug. A baker will make sure that the proportions are as precise as possible. 
Now the mixing 
Dough mixing is divided into two phases. A slow mixing phase, followed by a quicker second kneading period. In the first step, the aim is to disperse the mixture evenly to produce an even amount. A long slow mix encourages gluten to develop into nice and long slices that support craftsmanship. Typically, slow mixing lasts about 2-10 minutes. During the second level, the dough is vigorously kneaded. This accelerates the fermentation rate of dough, in particular the production of gluten. 
The gluten is reinforced so that it can then form a frame. The structure preserves gas in small pockets that expands to raise the flour. 
Fermentation 
Once the meal is hydrated and the ingredients are combined, it begins to ferment. It involves the formation of a gluten structure and gas production. There is more to it, though! Fermentation also affects the production of more complex meal components. Flavors, aromas and consistency of storage and changes from a long cycle of fermentation. It enhances the bread's feel, taste and scent. 

After a mixing stage, which is also known as bulk fermentation, most artisan bread dough remains to rest. The recovery time is between one and 24 hours (or bulk fermentation). 
Several bakers make bread without having to rest. This is by following the bread making process of Chorleywood. The remaining stage is skipped by many modern bakers. They contain additional ingredients known as enzymes, emulsifiers, flavours or enhancers to promote dough. 
The rest time allows the flour to ferment more complex elements. These add new flavours and flavours that enhance the bread 's look, taste and smell. Mixing dough is also a fermentation step. In addition, kneading can be absolutely skipped for a bread process without kneading. 
A unkneadable recipe simply includes the ingredients lightly and then rests on the mix. It is known to be a spontaneous fermentation. This produces a single kind of bread with an odd loose crumb. Sourdough is a very common way to make it. 
Extend and fold 
Often to maximise the strength of the dough, for the rest, I have curves and folds in the dough. This is where the dough is squared, extended and folded on both sides. 
It doesn't look so dramatic, but the finished product makes a big difference. 
You take the rest of the dough to stretch and fold, shape it in a rough square or triangle, spread it to one side and fold it over. 
Then replicate on each of the four sides the stretch and fold. Allow a stretch and fold while the dough rest offers more energy for the flour. They 're so fast! 
Start of Growth 
After the dough is formed for the correct time, it is ready for its final rise. It is the part where the dough is shaped and helped to rise. 
Once it reaches the right size it is ready (usually) to be sliced and cooked. But before this there's a stage or two! 
Dividing
The dough is measured to the correct weights here. A tonne of flour also provides a range of bread styles and sizes. Therefore, after dough fermentation is completed, it is then divided into individual weight-determined pieces. 
There is a wide 800 g loaf at 950-965 g. 
A medium loaf of 400 g is 485-495 g 
A long bread like a baguette of 400 g is 550 g 
These weights are not certain and can be changed to improve the output from the dough mix or to enhance the appearance and pleasure of the bread. 
Some handcrafted cobs are 650 g in size and offer a larger alternative. The paste is then degassed. 
Degassing 
When the dough portion is broken into the correct weight, it is degassed. It is where the baker 's hands place the dough on the counter. 
Degassing is performed to remove as much oxygen from the dough as possible. An successful degassing activity would build an even crumb foundation. 
Shaping
The bread dough is formed into a circular or oval piece upon degassing. It remains on the table for 5 to 10 minutes. This helps the dough to relax and grow. 
This is moulded until the dough has rested. A baker uses one of many bread-forming techniques. 
Proofing
The piece of dough is placed immediately in a tin, basket or tray after shaping. This stage is sometimes referred to as the second ascent, but I refuse to call it that personally. Proofing is usually 1 â€“ 5 hours long, depending on the yeast quantity and the room temperature. 
How do you prove? 
The final evidence must not be in a bowl or in a bottle. A couch is used for baguette and ciabatta bread. It helps to give them their distinctive shape. 
A couche is a cloth that acts as a barrier between the dough pieces. It lets the bread rise upwards rather than laterally. The final evidence can also be produced on a wooden tray or baked sheet. 
Cut the bread 
Bread needs to be sliced before hitting the oven. A thin knife called a lame is used to make an incision before the dough reaches the oven. 
It allows waste gas to disperse, which otherwise would bubble through the air. If the dough is not sliced, it is extremely likely that the surface can not withhold the gas emitted during the furnace spring. 
It causes the crust to break or "split" because the strength of the dough is inadequate to contain the gas in it. The dough is made of high protein grain, good quality grain or lengthy mixing / fermentation times with a solid structure. 
Thanks to their improved composition, these breads will not always have to be sliced because the gas is preserved. 
Bake it 
The majority of bread baking methods require the use of a bakery and steam. Before the bread strikes the oven, the stone is preheated. It aid bakes the bread 's bottom. 
Baking stones allow the heat to easily reach the bread and cause the oven to begin to be cold. In the first 5-10 minutes of baking the bread springs up in the oven. Oven is great for a lighter crumb in the bread and also indispensable for a nice crust! 
Adding steam to the oven is a crucial factor as it allows the surface of the dough to resist resistance quickly so that the bread can appear. 
Cooling
Cooling is required in order to make bread. The failure to allow the bread to cool will affect the bread 's quality. The gluten gelatinizes and shapes the crumb structure during the cooling period. 
Moisture is contained in the crumb, and it's a smart thing to make it the finest. The hot loaf has damaged the structure and makes it possible for humidity to escape. 
It is also not good to eat hot fresh bread from the stomach. Even a few can make you feel ill! After cooling is finished, the bread is usually ready to be sliced and eaten between 2 and 4 hours.
